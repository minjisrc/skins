# Skins
List of skins I use and edits (some of them are reuploads because I don't find their links anymore.)

## Disclaimer
I'm not the original creator of any previous skins; you can replicate them as well. I either mixed elements from other skins I liked, added two new things (like images, color changes, etc.), or—in most cases—removed stuff I thought was unnecessary.
